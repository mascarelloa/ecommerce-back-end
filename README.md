  ## Description 
  This is a backend database that simulates an e-commerce datebase. It is comprised of products, product categories, and product tags and uses CRUD operations to create/post, read/get, update/put, and delete items. This program was built with Node.js, MySQL/Sequelize, and tested using Insomnia.
